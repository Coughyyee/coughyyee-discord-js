This GitHub Repository Is For The Series On My Youtube Channel Called: How to make a Discord Bot using JavaScript!

I Would Reccomend Watching The Videos and Copy The code From There Than Just Copy It From Here As You Might Learn Something Through Watching My Videos.
But If You Just Wanna Use Them Then.. Here They are ;)

Any Questions, Leave Them in The Comment Sections Of The Video Or.. DM Me On Discord: Coughyyee..#9447
